# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook

This repository contains the official Panaversity capstone textbook for the 13-week Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course. The textbook takes students from zero to fully autonomous simulated humanoid robot using ROS 2, Isaac Sim, and Vision-Language-Action models.

## Overview

This AI-native textbook teaches students how to build and control humanoid robots using state-of-the-art technologies:

- **ROS 2 (Robotic Nervous System)**: Robot operating system for communication and control
- **Isaac Sim (Digital Twin)**: NVIDIA's simulation environment for robot development
- **Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Models**: Integration of perception, language, and action for intelligent robot behavior

## Prerequisites

- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
- RTX 4070 Ti or equivalent GPU
- ROS 2 Kilted Kaiju
- NVIDIA Isaac Sim 2025
- Node.js 18+ for documentation

## Getting Started
