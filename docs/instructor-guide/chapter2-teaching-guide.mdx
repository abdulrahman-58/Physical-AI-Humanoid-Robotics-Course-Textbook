## Common Student Questions and Answers

### Installation and Setup Questions

**Q: I'm getting an error saying "No CUDA-capable device is detected" during installation. What should I do?**
A: This indicates that Isaac Sim cannot find your NVIDIA GPU. Check:
1. Is your GPU supported? (RTX 4070 Ti or better)
2. Are your NVIDIA drivers properly installed? Run `nvidia-smi` to verify
3. Is CUDA properly configured? Check with `nvcc --version`
4. If using SSH, ensure X11 forwarding is enabled

**Q: Isaac Sim won't launch, it just crashes immediately. How can I fix this?**
A: This is often a graphics driver or memory issue:
1. Update your NVIDIA drivers to the latest version
2. Ensure you have sufficient VRAM (12GB minimum for Isaac Sim)
3. Close other GPU-intensive applications
4. Try running Isaac Sim with reduced quality settings
5. Check the Isaac Sim logs for specific error messages

**Q: The Isaac Sim interface looks strange or has rendering issues.**
A: Rendering issues are typically driver-related:
1. Update to the latest NVIDIA Studio Drivers (not Game Ready drivers)
2. Ensure your display is connected to the NVIDIA GPU (not integrated graphics)
3. Check that Isaac Sim is using the NVIDIA GPU in power management settings
4. Try adjusting the viewport quality settings in Isaac Sim

### Physics and Simulation Questions

**Q: My robot falls through the ground plane in simulation. How do I fix this?**
A: This is a common physics configuration issue:
1. Ensure the ground plane has infinite mass (static collision shape)
2. Check that physics is enabled in the scene (press Play button)
3. Verify the ground plane is properly positioned and scaled
4. Check that your robot has appropriate mass and collision shapes
5. Ensure the physics timestep is appropriate for your simulation

**Q: Why does my robot behave differently in simulation vs. real life?**
A: Simulation vs. reality differences arise from:
1. Simplified physics models in simulation
2. Environmental factors not modeled (friction variations, air currents)
3. Sensor noise and uncertainty not perfectly replicated
4. Manufacturing tolerances in real hardware
5. Time delays and communication latencies not simulated
6. Emphasize that simulation is for testing concepts, not perfect prediction

**Q: How do I tune physics parameters for realistic behavior?**
A: Physics tuning requires iterative testing:
1. Start with realistic mass properties for your robot
2. Use appropriate friction coefficients (0.5-0.8 for rubber on ground)
3. Adjust restitution (bounciness) - usually low for robots (0.1-0.3)
4. Tune simulation timestep (smaller = more accurate but slower)
5. Test with simple scenarios first, then increase complexity

### ROS 2 Integration Questions

**Q: I can't see my ROS 2 topics in Isaac Sim. What's wrong?**
A: Connection issues typically involve:
1. Verify ROS 2 environment is sourced in the terminal where Isaac Sim runs
2. Check that ROS_DOMAIN_ID is the same for both Isaac Sim and ROS 2 nodes
3. Ensure the ROS 2 Bridge extension is enabled in Isaac Sim
4. Verify topic names match between your ROS 2 nodes and Isaac Sim configuration
5. Restart both Isaac Sim and ROS 2 nodes if needed

**Q: My robot moves in simulation but not in the real world, or vice versa.**
A: This indicates model-plant mismatch:
1. Verify that simulation parameters match real robot (mass, dimensions, motor specs)
2. Check that control gains are appropriate for simulation vs. real hardware
3. Consider that simulation may be too idealistic (no noise, delays, etc.)
4. Gradually add realistic elements to simulation (noise, delays, uncertainties)
5. Use system identification to tune simulation parameters to match real behavior

**Q: How do I simulate sensors like cameras or LiDAR in Isaac Sim?**
A: Isaac Sim provides realistic sensor simulation:
1. Add sensor prims to your robot model (Isaac/Sensors/ folder)
2. Configure sensor parameters (FOV, range, resolution)
3. Enable the ROS 2 Bridge extension
4. Sensors will publish to ROS 2 topics automatically
5. Use Isaac Sim's sensor documentation for specific configuration details
