Welcome to the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook! This comprehensive guide will take you from zero to developing fully autonomous simulated humanoid robots using cutting-edge technologies.

## What You'll Learn

In this textbook, you will:
- Master ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) for robot communication and control
- Use NVIDIA Isaac Sim for advanced robot simulation and testing
- Integrate Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for intelligent robot behavior
- Build and control humanoid robots in simulation and eventually in the real world

## Course Structure

This textbook follows a 13-week curriculum with 7 core chapters:

1. **ROS 2 Basics** - Learn the fundamentals of robot communication
2. **Isaac Sim Setup** - Master simulation environments for robot development
3. **Robot Control Theory** - Understand how to make robots move
4. **Perception Systems** - Teach robots to see and understand their environment
5. **Vision-Language-Action Integration** - Connect perception with intelligent action
6. **Humanoid Locomotion** - Make humanoid robots walk and move naturally
7. **Capstone Project** - Build a fully autonomous humanoid robot

## Hardware Requirements

To get the most out of this textbook, you'll need:

<details>
<summary>Recommended Hardware Setup</summary>

- **Computer**: RTX 4070 Ti or equivalent GPU
- **OS**: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
- **RAM**: 32GB recommended
- **Storage**: 100GB free space

For physical robot experimentation:
- **Robot Platform**: Unitree G1 (or similar humanoid platform)
- **Computing**: Jetson Orin Nano Super
- **Sensors**: Intel RealSense D435i depth camera
</details>

## Getting Started

Before diving into the content, make sure you have:
1. A properly configured Ubuntu 22.04 system
2. ROS 2 Kilted Kaiju installed
3. NVIDIA Isaac Sim 2025 set up with compatible drivers
4. This textbook repository cloned and dependencies installed

## Learning Approach

This textbook follows a hands-on approach where theory is immediately followed by practical implementation. Each chapter includes:

- Core concepts and theory
- Step-by-step tutorials
- Lab exercises to reinforce learning
- Troubleshooting guides for common issues

<LabExercise
  title="Getting Started Lab"
  objectives={[
    "Verify your development environment is properly set up",
    "Run your first ROS 2 command",
    "Confirm Isaac Sim is accessible"
  ]}
  prerequisites={[
    "Ubuntu 22.04 installed",
    "ROS 2 Kilted Kaiju installed",
    "NVIDIA Isaac Sim 2025 installed"
  ]}
  steps={[
    "Open a terminal and source ROS 2: `source /opt/ros/rolling/setup.bash`",
    "Verify ROS 2 installation: `ros2 --version`",
    "Check for Isaac Sim installation directory",
    "Create a test directory: `mkdir ~/physical_ai_test && cd ~/physical_ai_test`"
  ]}
  expectedOutcome="You should see the ROS 2 version and have a test directory created"
  troubleshootingTips={[
    "If `ros2` command is not found, ensure you've sourced the ROS 2 environment in your shell profile",
    "If Isaac Sim is not found, verify the installation path and permissions"
  ]}
