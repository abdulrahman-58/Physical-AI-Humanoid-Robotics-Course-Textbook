ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) is a flexible framework for writing robot software. It's a collection of tools, libraries, and conventions that aim to simplify the task of creating complex and robust robot behavior across a wide variety of robot platforms and environments.

## What is ROS 2?

ROS 2 is not an operating system in the traditional sense, but rather a middleware framework that provides services designed for a heterogeneous computer cluster. It includes:

- Hardware abstraction
- Device drivers
- Libraries
- Visualizers
- Message-passing
- Package management
- And more

## Key Advantages of ROS 2

### 1. Distributed Computing
ROS 2 allows you to distribute computation across multiple machines, which is essential for humanoid robots that may have separate computers for perception, control, and high-level planning.

### 2. Language Agnostic
While we'll primarily use Python in this textbook, ROS 2 supports multiple programming languages including C++, Python, and Rust.

### 3. Real-time Capabilities
ROS 2 provides real-time scheduling capabilities that are crucial for robot control applications.

### 4. Security
Unlike ROS 1, ROS 2 includes built-in security features that are important for deployed robotic systems.

## ROS 2 vs ROS 1

ROS 2 was developed to address limitations of ROS 1:

- **Better real-time support**: Essential for robot control
- **Improved security**: Built-in authentication and encryption
- **Cross-platform support**: Works on Linux, macOS, Windows, and RTOS
- **Modern toolchain**: Based on DDS (Data Distribution Service) for communication

## Core ROS 2 Architecture

The fundamental concepts in ROS 2 are:

1. **Nodes**: Processes that perform computation
2. **Topics**: Named buses over which nodes exchange messages
3. **Services**: Synchronous request/response communication
4. **Actions**: Goal-oriented communication patterns
5. **Parameters**: Configuration values that can be changed at runtime

### Nodes
A node is a process that performs computation. In a well-designed ROS 2 system, each node should have a single, specific purpose. For example, a humanoid robot might have nodes for:
- Joint control
- Perception processing
- Path planning
- High-level behavior

### Topics and Messages
Topics allow nodes to exchange data in a publish/subscribe pattern. A node publishes messages to a topic, and other nodes subscribe to that topic to receive the messages. This enables asynchronous communication between nodes.

### Services
Services provide synchronous request/response communication. A client sends a request to a service, and the service sends back a response. This is useful for operations that need to complete before the client can continue.

### Actions
Actions are used for long-running tasks that have feedback and can be canceled. They're ideal for navigation, manipulation, or any task that takes a significant amount of time.

## ROS 2 Ecosystem

ROS 2 includes a rich ecosystem of packages that are essential for robotics:

- **Navigation2**: For robot navigation and path planning
- **MoveIt2**: For motion planning and manipulation
- **Vision**: For computer vision and image processing
- **Control**: For robot control and dynamics
- **Simulation**: For robot simulation and testing

## Setting Up Your ROS 2 Environment

Before diving into coding, you need to set up your ROS 2 environment:

```bash
# Source the ROS 2 installation (add this to your ~/.bashrc file)
source /opt/ros/rolling/setup.bash

# Create a workspace for your custom packages
mkdir -p ~/ros2_ws/src
cd ~/ros2_ws

# Source the workspace (after building packages)
source install/setup.bash
```

## ROS 2 Tools

ROS 2 provides many command-line tools for debugging and monitoring:

- `ros2 run`: Run a node
- `ros2 topic`: Inspect and interact with topics
- `ros2 service`: Inspect and interact with services
- `ros2 action`: Inspect and interact with actions
- `ros2 node`: Inspect nodes
- `rqt`: Graphical tools for visualization
- `rviz2`: 3D visualization tool
