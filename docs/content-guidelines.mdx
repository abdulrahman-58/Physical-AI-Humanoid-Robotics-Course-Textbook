# Content Creation Guidelines

These guidelines ensure all textbook content aligns with the project constitution and maintains consistent quality.

## Core Principles

### 1. Teach-First Mindset
- Every explanation must be clear, hands-on, and immediately testable
- Prioritize student understanding and practical application over theoretical completeness
- Include runnable code examples with expected outputs
- Provide step-by-step instructions that students can follow independently

### 2. Curriculum Alignment
- All content must align 100% with Panaversity curriculum modules and learning outcomes
- Every chapter and lab must map directly to specific learning objectives
- Reference official curriculum breakdown (Weeks 1-13) when creating content

### 3. Technical Accuracy and Future-Proofing
- All technical information must be accurate as of December 2025
- Include current tools, versions, prices, and hardware specifications
- Code snippets must be syntactically correct, copy-paste-ready, and tested with rclpy
- Verify all technical claims are accurate and verifiable

### 4. Hardware Accessibility
- All recommendations must be achievable with realistic student hardware: Ubuntu 22.04 + ROS 2 Kilted Kaiju + NVIDIA Isaac Sim 2025
- Include current real prices and exact model numbers
- Provide alternatives when possible for students with different budgets

### 5. Zero Hallucination Policy
- No technical facts, URDF, ROS 2 APIs, or Isaac Sim features may be fabricated
- All technical claims must be verifiable and accurate
- If uncertain about technical details, clearly state limitations rather than making assumptions

### 6. Embodied Intelligence Philosophy
- The concept of embodied intelligence must be woven into every chapter
- Emphasize the integration of perception, cognition, and action in physical systems

## Content Structure Requirements

### Markdown and Documentation Format
- All content must be Spec-Kit Plus + Docusaurus-ready (MDX, proper headings, tables, code blocks)
- Every major concept must have a described diagram or suggested image to enhance understanding
- Use proper heading hierarchy (H1 for chapter, H2 for sections, H3 for subsections)

### Code Quality Standards
- All code snippets must run on Ubuntu 22.04 + ROS 2 Kilted Kaiju + NVIDIA Isaac Sim 2025
- Code must be copy-paste-ready and immediately testable
- All code examples must follow rclpy best practices and include proper error handling
- Include expected output or behavior for each code example

### Content Tagging
- Content must be tagged for beginner/intermediate/advanced tracks to enable personalization
- Use the `<DifficultyIndicator level="beginner|intermediate|advanced" />` component
- Clearly indicate prerequisites for each section

## Writing Style

### Accessibility
- Write for non-technical stakeholders while maintaining technical accuracy
- Use clear, concise language
- Provide context for technical terms when first introduced
- Include alternative text for all diagrams and images

### Practical Focus
- Focus on what students can do with the knowledge, not just what they should know
- Include real-world applications and examples
- Connect concepts to practical implementation

## Review Process

Before publishing any content:
1. Verify technical accuracy in the target environment
2. Test all code examples and ensure they execute as expected
3. Confirm alignment with curriculum objectives
4. Check that difficulty level is appropriately marked
5. Ensure all diagrams have proper alt text for accessibility
