- **Storage**: 20GB free space for Isaac Sim + additional space for assets
- **Display**: 1920x1080 minimum resolution

### Software Requirements
- **OS**: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (as specified in curriculum)
- **NVIDIA Driver**: 535.0 or later (for Isaac Sim 2025)
- **CUDA**: 12.0 or later
- **Python**: 3.10 (compatible with ROS 2 Kilted Kaiju)

## Pre-Installation Checks

Before proceeding, verify your system configuration:

```bash
# Check NVIDIA driver version
nvidia-smi

# Check CUDA version
nvcc --version

# Check Ubuntu version
lsb_release -a

# Verify GPU is detected
lspci | grep -i nvidia
```

## Isaac Sim Installation

### Method 1: Download from NVIDIA Developer Portal (Recommended)

1. **Create an NVIDIA Developer Account**
   - Go to [developer.nvidia.com](https://developer.nvidia.com)
   - Register for a free account if you don't have one
   - Navigate to the Isaac Sim page

2. **Download Isaac Sim 2025**
   - Select the Ubuntu 22.04 version
   - Download the `.run` installer file
   - The file will be named similar to `isaac-sim-2025.1.0-ubuntu22.04-release.run`

3. **Make the Installer Executable**
   ```bash
   chmod +x isaac-sim-*.run
   ```

4. **Run the Installer**
   ```bash
   sudo ./isaac-sim-*.run
   ```

5. **Follow the Installation Wizard**
   - Accept the license agreement
   - Choose installation directory (default: `/isaac-sim`)
   - Select components to install (recommended: all components)

### Method 2: Using Isaac Sim Docker Container (Alternative)

If you prefer using Docker for isolation:

```bash
# Pull the Isaac Sim Docker image
docker pull nvcr.io/nvidia/isaac-sim:2025.1.0

# Run Isaac Sim with GPU support
xhost +local:docker
docker run --gpus all -it --rm \
  --network=host \
  --env="DISPLAY" \
  --env="QT_X11_NO_MITSHM=1" \
  --volume="/tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix:rw" \
  --volume="/home/$USER:/workspace:rw" \
  --volume="/dev/shm:/dev/shm" \
  --privileged \
  nvcr.io/nvidia/isaac-sim:2025.1.0
```

## Post-Installation Configuration

### 1. Environment Setup

Add Isaac Sim to your environment by adding these lines to your `~/.bashrc`:

```bash
# Isaac Sim Environment
export ISAACSIM_PATH="/isaac-sim"  # Adjust path if installed elsewhere
export ISAACSIM_PYTHON_PATH="$ISAACSIM_PATH/python.sh"
export ISAACSIM_NUCLEUS_SERVER_URI="omniverse://localhost/Nucleus"
```

Then source your bashrc:
```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

### 2. Verify Installation

Test the installation by launching Isaac Sim:

```bash
# Launch Isaac Sim GUI
$ISAACSIM_PATH/isaac-sim.launch.sh
```

If successful, the Isaac Sim Omniverse application should start with the default scene.

### 3. ROS 2 Bridge Setup

To enable ROS 2 integration:

```bash
# Navigate to Isaac Sim directory
cd $ISAACSIM_PATH

# Verify ROS 2 bridge is available
ls -la python/omni.isaac.ros2_bridge*

# Source ROS 2 environment
source /opt/ros/rolling/setup.bash

# Set ROS_DOMAIN_ID for Isaac Sim (optional)
export ROS_DOMAIN_ID=1
```

## Isaac Sim Configuration for Robotics

### 1. Omniverse Nucleus Setup

For single-user development (default setup):

1. Launch Isaac Sim
2. Go to Window → Extension Manager
3. Search for "Nucleus" extensions
4. Enable Omniverse Nucleus Client
5. Configure to use local Nucleus server

### 2. Physics Settings

For realistic humanoid robot simulation:

1. Go to Window → Physics → Physics Settings
2. Set Gravity to -9.81 m/s² (Z-axis)
3. Adjust solver settings for accuracy vs. performance:
   - Solver Type: TGS
   - Position Iterations: 4-8
   - Velocity Iterations: 1

### 3. USD Stage Setup

Isaac Sim uses USD (Universal Scene Description) for scene representation:

1. Create a new stage (Ctrl+N)
2. Save as a new USD file (.usd extension)
3. Set up layers for different components (robot, environment, etc.)

## Common Installation Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: "No CUDA-capable device is detected"
- **Symptoms**: Isaac Sim fails to start with CUDA errors
- **Solution**: Verify NVIDIA drivers are properly installed and GPU is detected
  ```bash
  nvidia-smi
  # If GPU not listed, reinstall NVIDIA drivers
  sudo apt install nvidia-driver-535
  sudo reboot
  ```

### Issue 2: "Display not found" when launching GUI
- **Symptoms**: Isaac Sim fails to start GUI with display errors
- **Solution**: Ensure X11 forwarding is enabled if using SSH, or run locally
  ```bash
  # Check display
  echo $DISPLAY
  # Should return something like ":0" or "localhost:10.0"
  ```

### Issue 3: "Omniverse connection failed"
- **Symptoms**: Cannot connect to Omniverse services
- **Solution**: For local development, configure to use local Nucleus server
  - Go to Window → Omniverse → Connection
  - Set server to "http://localhost:3080"

### Issue 4: Performance issues with complex scenes
- **Symptoms**: Slow rendering or physics simulation
- **Solution**: Adjust quality settings in Isaac Sim
  - Go to Window → Stage → USD Stage Viewport
  - Reduce rendering quality for development
  - Use proxy representations for complex models

## Testing Your Installation

### Basic Test
1. Launch Isaac Sim: `$ISAACSIM_PATH/isaac-sim.launch.sh`
2. Create a new stage (Ctrl+N)
3. Add a primitive cube (Window → Create → Primitive → Cube)
4. Verify physics by adding a ground plane and enabling physics
5. Run the simulation and observe the cube falling

### ROS 2 Integration Test
1. Create a simple scene with a cube
2. Enable ROS 2 bridge extension
3. Verify ROS 2 topics are available in Isaac Sim
4. Test communication with external ROS 2 nodes

## Optimizing for Your Hardware

### For RTX 4070 Ti (12GB VRAM)
- Keep scene complexity moderate
- Use proxy representations during scene setup
- Reduce viewport quality during development
- Close other GPU-intensive applications

### Performance Settings
- **Viewport Quality**: Medium for development, High for final renders
- **Physics Substeps**: 1-2 for real-time simulation, higher for accuracy
- **Multi-Viewport**: Disable if not needed

## Next Steps

Once Isaac Sim is installed and configured, proceed to the next section to learn about simulation concepts and physics. Then, complete the hands-on lab exercise to create your first simulation environment and connect it with ROS 2.
