# Budget-Conscious Hardware Alternatives

<DifficultyIndicator level="beginner" />

This guide provides affordable hardware alternatives and phased approaches for students with financial constraints. The Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course can be approached with various budget levels, and this guide outlines practical ways to participate regardless of financial situation.

## Phased Approach Philosophy

Rather than requiring all hardware upfront, we recommend a **phased approach** that allows students to start with essential components and expand as budget allows.

### Phase 1: Simulation-Only Learning (Budget: $1,000-$1,500)
Focus on learning concepts through simulation before investing in physical hardware.

### Phase 2: Embedded Computing (Budget: +$250)
Add Jetson platform for embedded robotics work.

### Phase 3: Physical Hardware (Budget: +$16,000)
Add humanoid robot platform for real-world implementation.
