# Personalization Features Testing

<DifficultyIndicator level="intermediate" />

This document outlines the testing procedures for personalization features with different student profiles. The tests validate that content adapts appropriately to different skill levels and learning preferences.

## Test Profiles

### Profile 1: Beginner Student
```json
{
  "id": "student-beginner-001",
  "skillLevel": "beginner",
  "preferredLearningPath": "theoretical",
  "personalizationSettings": {
    "difficultyFilter": "beginner",
    "learningPath": "theoretical",
    "showAdvancedContent": false,
    "showSimplifiedExplanations": true,
    "includeAdditionalExamples": true,
    "highlightKeyConcepts": true
  }
}
```

**Expected Behavior**:
- Content filtered to beginner level only
- Simplified explanations displayed
- Additional examples included
- Key concepts highlighted
- Advanced content hidden
- Theoretical focus emphasized

### Profile 2: Intermediate Student
```json
{
  "id": "student-intermediate-002",
  "skillLevel": "intermediate",
  "preferredLearningPath": "mixed",
  "personalizationSettings": {
    "difficultyFilter": "intermediate",
    "learningPath": "mixed",
    "showAdvancedContent": false,
    "showSimplifiedExplanations": false,
    "includeAdditionalExamples": true,
    "highlightKeyConcepts": true
  }
}
```

**Expected Behavior**:
- Content filtered to beginner and intermediate levels
- Moderate level of detail
- Some additional examples
- Concepts highlighted appropriately
- Advanced content hidden
- Mixed theoretical and practical approach

### Profile 3: Advanced Student
```json
{
  "id": "student-advanced-003",
  "skillLevel": "advanced",
  "preferredLearningPath": "practical",
  "personalizationSettings": {
    "difficultyFilter": "advanced",
    "learningPath": "practical",
    "showAdvancedContent": true,
    "showSimplifiedExplanations": false,
    "includeAdditionalExamples": false,
    "highlightKeyConcepts": true
  }
}
```

**Expected Behavior**:
- All content levels accessible
- Advanced content displayed
- Minimal simplified explanations
- Focus on practical implementation
- Advanced examples and challenges included

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Content Filtering
**Objective**: Verify that content is properly filtered based on difficulty level.

**Steps**:
1. Load the textbook with Beginner profile
2. Navigate to Chapter 1
3. Verify only beginner-appropriate content is displayed
4. Repeat with Intermediate and Advanced profiles

**Expected Results**:
- Beginner profile: Only basic concepts and simplified explanations
- Intermediate profile: Moderate complexity content
- Advanced profile: All content including advanced sections

### Scenario 2: Learning Path Adaptation
**Objective**: Verify that content adapts to preferred learning path.

**Steps**:
1. Load textbook with "theoretical" learning path
2. Navigate to ROS 2 concepts section
3. Verify theoretical explanations are emphasized
4. Switch to "practical" learning path
5. Verify practical examples are emphasized

**Expected Results**:
- Theoretical path: More mathematical explanations, algorithmic focus
- Practical path: More implementation details, hands-on examples
- Mixed path: Balanced approach

### Scenario 3: Progress Tracking
**Objective**: Verify that progress is tracked correctly per profile.

**Steps**:
1. Complete Chapter 1 with Beginner profile
2. Verify progress is recorded
3. Switch to Intermediate profile
4. Verify progress is appropriately tracked

**Expected Results**:
- Progress is maintained per profile
- Personalization settings persist between sessions
- Cross-profile contamination does not occur

### Scenario 4: Component Functionality
**Objective**: Verify that personalization components function correctly.

**Components to Test**:
- DifficultyFilter component
- PersonalizationPanel component
- ProgressTracker component
- LearningPathSelector component

**Steps**:
1. Verify each component renders without errors
2. Verify interactive elements function correctly
3. Verify state management works properly
4. Verify responsive design works on different screen sizes

**Expected Results**:
- All components render correctly
- Interactive elements respond to user input
- State persists appropriately
- Components are responsive and accessible
