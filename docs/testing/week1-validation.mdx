# Week 1 Content Validation

<DifficultyIndicator level="beginner" />

This document outlines the validation procedures for Week 1 content to ensure it works correctly on the target hardware setup: RTX 4070 Ti + Ubuntu 22.04.

## Hardware Requirements

- **GPU**: RTX 4070 Ti (or equivalent)
- **OS**: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
- **RAM**: 16GB minimum (32GB recommended)
- **Storage**: 50GB free space for ROS 2 and Isaac Sim
- **Processor**: Multi-core processor (Intel i7 or AMD Ryzen equivalent)

## Prerequisites Verification

Before testing Week 1 content, verify that your system meets these requirements:

### 1. Ubuntu 22.04 Verification
```bash
lsb_release -a
```
Expected output should show Ubuntu 22.04.x LTS.

### 2. ROS 2 Installation Verification
```bash
source /opt/ros/rolling/setup.bash
ros2 --version
```
Expected output: `ros2 foxy` or later version (Kilted Kaiju).

### 3. Python 3.10+ Verification
```bash
python3 --version
```
Expected output: Python 3.10 or higher.

## Week 1 Content Tests

### Test 1: Basic ROS 2 Commands
**Objective**: Verify basic ROS 2 functionality

**Steps**:
1. Open a terminal
2. Source ROS 2: `source /opt/ros/rolling/setup.bash`
3. Run: `ros2 topic list`
4. Run: `ros2 node list`

**Expected Results**:
- No errors should occur
- Commands should execute successfully
- Should show available topics/nodes (even if empty initially)

### Test 2: Publisher/Subscriber Example
**Objective**: Verify the publisher and subscriber example from Lab 1 works

**Steps**:
1. Create a test workspace:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/test_ws/src
   cd ~/test_ws
   ```
2. Copy the publisher_example.py and subscriber_example.py files to a new package
3. Build the package: `colcon build --packages-select my_robot_tutorials`
4. Source the workspace: `source install/setup.bash`
5. In terminal 1: `ros2 run my_robot_tutorials talker`
6. In terminal 2: `ros2 run my_robot_tutorials listener`

**Expected Results**:
- Publisher should output "Publishing: 'Hello World: X'" every 0.5 seconds
- Subscriber should output "I heard: 'Hello World: X'" in response
- Messages should match between publisher and subscriber

### Test 3: ROS 2 Tools Verification
**Objective**: Verify ROS 2 monitoring tools work

**Steps**:
1. With the publisher/subscriber running, open a third terminal
2. Source ROS 2: `source /opt/ros/rolling/setup.bash`
3. Run: `ros2 node list`
4. Run: `ros2 topic list`
5. Run: `ros2 topic echo /topic std_msgs/msg/String`

**Expected Results**:
- Should see both 'minimal_publisher' and 'minimal_subscriber' nodes
- Should see '/topic' in the topic list
- Should see the same messages being published by the talker node

### Test 4: Code Validation Script
**Objective**: Verify the validation script works correctly

**Steps**:
1. Navigate to the code examples directory
2. Run the validation script: `python3 validate_examples.py`

**Expected Results**:
- Script should run without errors
- Should report "All ROS 2 examples passed validation!"

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue 1: "Command 'ros2' not found"
**Symptoms**: ROS 2 commands return "command not found"
**Solution**:
- Verify ROS 2 installation: `ls /opt/ros/rolling/`
- Source the setup file: `source /opt/ros/rolling/setup.bash`
- Add to shell profile: `echo "source /opt/ros/rolling/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc`

### Issue 2: Publisher/Subscriber not communicating
**Symptoms**: Publisher runs but subscriber doesn't receive messages
**Solution**:
- Ensure both terminals have sourced the workspace
- Check ROS_DOMAIN_ID is the same in both terminals: `echo $ROS_DOMAIN_ID`
- Verify topic names match exactly

### Issue 3: Python import errors
**Symptoms**: "ModuleNotFoundError" for rclpy or std_msgs
**Solution**:
- Verify ROS 2 Python packages are installed: `pip3 list | grep ros`
- Install missing packages: `sudo apt install python3-ros-interfaces`

## Performance Expectations

### Expected Performance on RTX 4070 Ti + Ubuntu 22.04:
- ROS 2 commands should execute in < 1 second
- Publisher/Subscriber communication should have < 100ms latency
- Memory usage should remain stable during extended runs
- CPU usage should be moderate (20-40%) for basic examples

## Success Criteria

Week 1 content validation is successful if:
- [ ] All basic ROS 2 commands execute without errors
- [ ] Publisher/Subscriber example runs correctly
- [ ] ROS 2 tools can monitor the communication
- [ ] Code validation script passes
- [ ] No crashes or unexpected behavior occurs
- [ ] Performance meets expectations

## Next Steps

Once Week 1 content validation is complete, proceed to Week 2 content validation which will include Isaac Sim integration tests.
